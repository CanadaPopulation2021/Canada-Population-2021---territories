Footnotes:
1,"Figures may not add to totals due to rounding."
2,"Due to changes in methodology and improved data availability, the inventory counts are not comparable between years.   Inventory counts for the year 2018 for municipalities may be overestimated. Census subdivisions, including unorganized and unincorporated areas, were included in the survey frame whereas only incorporated organizations were included for 2020."
3,"As of 2018, indoor leisure pools facilities exclude those in combination with a 25-metre or 50-metre plus pool."
